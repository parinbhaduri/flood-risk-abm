# model_name

**Model Name**

Provide a short description of the model here.

\* corresponding author:  I. M. Human, emailid@myuni.edu

## Purpose

Write a description of the model and its intended purpose here. Think of this as an abstract (but you can use fancier formatting, like bullets.)

## Journal reference

If you're submitting a paper describing the model to an outlet like (JOSS)[https://joss.theoj.org/], you can provide a reference here, or just use a badge on top of the README.

## Data reference

If data is required to run your model (and is not included in this repository), provide references and links to minted data versions (ideally with a DOI).

_Example_: Human, I.M. (2021). My dataset name [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/some-doi-number

## Installation

### Dependencies

List packages (with versions) that you installed and relied on for your code (explicitly; any necessary "behind the scenes" packages that were installed by the package manager don't need to be mentioned), along with the versions (this will help ensure compatibility down the road). Depending on the package manager used, these may be easy to get from a `Project.toml`, `environment.yml`, or an analogous file. If you installed a package from its code repository, link to the repository and a link to its released version (ideally a DOI if available).

| Package | Version | Repository Link | DOI |
|-------|---------|-----------------|-----|
| dependency 1 | version | -- | -- |
| dependency 2 | version | link to code repository | link to DOI of release |

### Instructions

Provide instructions on how to install a released version of the model. 

## Getting Started

Provide instructions on how to configure and run the code. This can be a link to broader documentation (if written for the model) or listed here.

## Contribution Guidelines

Provide information on how people can contribute (for example, if they find bugs or want to submit a pull request).

## API Reference

If you've developed documentation for the model API (which is a good idea to facilitate future experiments), provide a link here.
